### Lists
(In this example, we leading and trailing spaces are shown with dots:)

```
1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
* Unordered sub-list
3. Actual numbers dont matter, just that it's a number
..1 Ordered sub-list
..2 Ordered sub-list
4. And another item

... You can have properly indented paragrahs within list items.
Notice tha blank like above 

...To have a line break without a paragrap, you will need to use two trailing space.  
...Note that this line is sperate, within the same paragraph.  
...(THis is contrary to the typical GFM line break behavior, where trailling space are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses
```

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item  
    * Unordered sub-list. 
    * Another unordred sub-list item.
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number  
    1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

    You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

    To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.  
    Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.  
    (This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

- Or minuses
+ Or pluses

### Links
There are two ways to create links

```markdown
[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. 
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes 
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org
[1]: http://slashdot.org
[link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com
```

### Code and Syntax Highlighting

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it

Blocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks ```,
or are indented with four spaces. 
```javascript
var s = "javascript string"
alert(s)
```

```python
s = b"Python byte string"
print s
```

### Tables

```
Colons can be used to align columns.
| Tables | Are | Cool|
|--------|-----|-----|
| col 1 | col 2 | col 3|
| x | centered | 13$ |
| xxx | yy | zz |
```

| Tables | Are | Cool|
|:--------|:-----:|-----:|

| x zzzzzz| centered | 13$ |

### Blockqoutes

> Blockqoutes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Qoute break.

> This is every long line that will still be qouted ...This is every long line that will still be qouted This is every long line that will still be qouted This is every long line that will still be qouted This is every long line that will still be qouted This is every long line that will still be qouted This is every long line that will still be qouted 

### Inline HTML
You can use raw HTML in your Markdown, and it work pretty well.

<dl>
 <dt> Definition list</dt>
 <dd> aaaa</dd>
 <dd> bbb</dd>
 <dd> ccc</dd>
</dl>


### Horozontal Rule


Three or more...    

---

Hyphens

***

Asterisks

___

Underscore




### Break lines

Here is a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines. so it will be a *separated paragrahp*

This line is also a separate paragrahp, but   
This line is only separated by single new lines, so will be *same paragraph*
